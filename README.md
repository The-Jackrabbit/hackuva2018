# Project Description
Our project allows a user to upload an image, then queries AWS's rekognition APIs using that image, and returns whether it "is a hotdog" or "is not a hotdog," along with some basic environmental and illicit content stats. This is a proof of concept; the end game is to foray into the realm of cross-comparing image classification tools (think: IBM, Face++, Microsoft, Clarifai) and their results, alongside providing intuitive data analysis that could expose underlying trends of bias in the same tools.
